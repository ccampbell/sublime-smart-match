# Sublime Text 2 Smart Match

Sublime Text 2 by default does not allow you to close parenthesis that are directly preceding other parenthesis.  This is the same behavior with brackets and square brackets.

This package makes it smarter so it detects if there are matching parenthesis on the other side to see if it is allowed.
